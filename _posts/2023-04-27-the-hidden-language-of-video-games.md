Most gamers that I know have been playing since they were kids. I have yet to meet someone who started playing video games after becoming an adult, although I'm sure they're out there. I find that interesting and I'd like to talk about this and why I think this has to do with the hidden language of video games.

Learning new languages is a hard task, but not so much for kids and I think the same applies to video games.

In what follows, I'll be using the computer as a platform for games without loss of generality.

If you're a gamer, I invite you to take note of what happens when you start a new game that you never played before. Unless it is an indie or a simulator, how much important is the tutorial for you? If this is a First Person Shooter, do you need the game to tell you that **WASD** will move your character? Or that **SPACE** is used for jumping? Or that you use the **MOUSE** for aiming and shooting? Probably not.

If we move to a different genre like RTS, the same still applies. Want to select multiple units? You might try to click and drag a box to select them. Need to open the build menu? Try pressing the **B** letter.

Although I won't go into details, this also happens in software development. If you start using a new software, pressing **CTRL+S** will likely save your work and pressing **CTRL+T** will probably open a new tab if the software supports it.

Keybinds and control schemas can be quickly memorized and the fact that most games use similar patterns is just an effect of years of game development that have converged to a similar control schema that works for everyone and you happened to learn this pattern by brute force. But even here you can already see some similarities with languages in how they change with time[^1].

This effect extends to other more "abstract aspects" like visual cues, game tropes, game mechanics and even game physics. To list another example, consider climbable walls in Third Person action games:

![climbable-wall-02](/assets/images/climbable-wall-02.webp){:.centered}{:width="500" }
![climbable-wall-03](/assets/images/climbable-wall-03.webp){:.centered}{:width="500" }
<br>
*These pictures show you three climbable walls in three different games, from top to bottom: Uncharted 4: A Thiefs End, Tomb Raider and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.*

If you're used to playing games like these you just need to glimpse at a wall to know it is climbable. You get visual cues through textures and colors and your brain is trained on picking these patterns. This was common (although unintended) with old cartoons, as you could predict which object in the scene would move because it had higher contrast and sharper details compared to the background!

Now take a look at the start of Last of Us. You start as a kid in her bedroom. You can only walk. There is no additional information on what to do or how to do it. But you know this is a scripted section of the game and that the game is inviting you to explore and interact with objects in the world. You quickly understood this even though you did not have to think about it. The game does not have to tell you "ok, welcome to Last of Us, in this part you need to walk and interact with objects". You also know that you're not supposed to interact with everything, only certain objects are interactable. You also know that you're supposed to keep moving towards where the map allows you to for the story to continue, otherwise, nothing will happen! Anyways, the list goes on!

All of this may seem obvious for a typical gamer, but for someone who hasn't played games in his or her life, it is not! To someone who hasn't played games, they might seem like they are supposed to simulate real life in some sense. This background as to what games should be is unique to each person and it brings a set of expectations as to how a game should behave. To that someone, this means a game should offer total freedom to the player. The character should be able to interact with this random object! I should be able to open this door! Why can't I jump over this box!? What the fuck is this invisible wall!? This may unsurprisingly lead to frustrations with the game just as our mother tongue might lead to frustrations with a new language due to things like false cognates.

In the end, I think this way of looking at games as language may help to explain why some people can grow tired of most triple AAA games. They learned the "META language", they are familiar with common elements used in these games and so they don't get their dopamine hit as they used to as a kid. As I get older, I've noticed that I'm enjoying more and more games that are story-centered, offer new and weird mechanics and even simulators. I even started to develop games all in the name of the sweet dopamine. One might say that I learned to speak the language and now I want to read and write new books with it.
