Discord is a VoIP and instant messaging social platform[^1] that is primarily used by gamers to communicate with friends and other players[^2]. At least that’s how it all started. Today Discord has become a social network with all kinds of communities ranging from NSFW content to study groups.

I use Discord every day. It does the job when it comes to keeping in touch with close friends. But similar to TeamSpeak or Mumble, that’s all it should have been. But “no, no, we as a family should aim to grow and expand Discord into infinity and maybe even Mars”, said some white rich guy that is somehow important to the financial stability of Discord as a company.

I see more and more game developers outsourcing all of the discussion about their games, including technical support[^3], to Discord channels. What the fuck, seriously. 

Allow me to be more practical in explaining my concern with what is happening with Discord through a recent experience that I had. Meet [Dark and Darker](https://www.ironmace.com/), the Dungeons and Dragons-*esque* game that follows a looter-shooter genre similar to [Escape From Tarkov](https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/), only with bows and swords and spells, that has made quite the success over the last months. They have an official Discord where all information about the game is shared and support is (theoretically) given. The channel currently has more than 150.000 members and growing (the counter is actually moving up while I look at it right now).

I had a friend with technical problems with this game and I tried helping him by searching for users that might be having the same problem. The only place I had any chance of finding such information was at their official Discord since not even the [Reddit community](https://reddit.com/r/darkanddarker) was as active as the Discord channel. So I tried using the search box at the top right corner of Discord. Have you ever done that? Do it someday in a big community like this one. Let’s say that the Gods have decided that today is your day and you find a lonely soul that has the same problem as you do. Nice, right? Yeah, except that you found the **QUESTION**, not the answer, so you’re not there yet. When you take a closer look at your results, you realize that this lonely user was simply ignored. He was ignored because in these communities with thousands of active users, the chat is just a giant schizophrenic hive mind that scrolls 50.000 lines per minute; a live chat where everyone is speaking and no one is talking[^4].

Now you might say, maybe this doesn’t happen with smaller communities and maybe someone has posted your solution in some more-well-behaved chat located at the Who The Fuck Knows channel. Maybe I'm becoming a Boomer who happens to be playing a [game that is currently too hyped](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkAndDarker/comments/12lyixr/discord_broken_by_a_short_message/). But the thing is that Discord is a platform that requires you to create an account and then you have to join a specific channel to be able to access and read their messages. This means that Discord can’t get indexed by search engines which in turn means that you have no way of looking for solutions to your problem inside the dark web that Discord is slowly becoming. At least this time we are creating “dark webs” that are managed by companies and I’m sure this is going to produce better results than the usual dark web.

And what If Discord, as a company, simply ceases to exist at some point? What is going to happen to all this content that is currently being produced inside Discord? Heck, we even have Midjourney inside Discord. [If you want to generate images using Midjourney you have to create an account on a “a VoIP and instant messaging social platform”](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/quick-start) (Discord, if you forgot the definition by now), join the Midjourney channel and then talk to a bot to generate your images… What the fuck!?

Now to the icing on the cake. You get this free tool with a beautiful interface, shiny and animated emojis, VoIP with great quality and the ability to create your own private channel and invite whoever agrees with you. You also get to be hidden from the rest of the web, especially the government. Add a little bit of salt and pepper to this recipe and *voilà*, you got a delicious pie ready to be served to all these armchair right-wing extremists, incels and alike who [would love to convince your kid to buy a gun and hate all women because they have the right to not kiss you](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/18/buffalo-shooting-twitch-discord-4chan-8chan-ny-ag/). Thankfully, Discord has all of this under control, I’m sure of it, they have a [big Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)! If the Internet has taught me something at least, is that if it all goes wrong for Discord we might get to see Elon Musk buying Discord, renaming it to Dogord and saving all of humanity from censorship.

In the end, I guess I just miss forums.
