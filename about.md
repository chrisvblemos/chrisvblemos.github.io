Gaia is a white [Maremma Sheepdog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maremmano-Abruzzese_Sheepdog). She is a lazy dog but very protective. Loves to destroy trash bags and eat paper when no one is looking. She grew up with 3 cats and now thinks she is a cat too. She will get in front of the TV if you're not petting her enough.

Galileu is an adopted stray dog. When mad he begins to dig holes at the backyard. Hates the sound of thunder. Lives under the couch. He likes women and despises men. He will tear your clothes apart with his black nails  given the chance. Can't stand another dog looking at him when dog walking.
